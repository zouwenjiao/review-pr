## Most accomplished

Below we look at which 5 characters from Star Wars are the most accomplished pilot (flew the fewest number of starships):

```{r table-of-most-accomplished-pilots}
accomp_pilots <- starwars %>% 
  unnest(films) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(10)

kable(accomp_pilots,
  col.names = c("Character", "Number of Starships piloted"))
```

By far, the most accomplished pilot of all is `r accomp_pilots$name[1]`. He is shown below piloting a starship.

```{r top-pilot, fig.cap="Most accomplished Star Wars pilot.", out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://starwarz.com/tbone/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/331.jpg",
                 )
```
